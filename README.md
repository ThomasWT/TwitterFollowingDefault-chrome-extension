# TwitterFollowingDefault-chrome-extension
The TwitterFollowingDefault Chrome extension changes the default Twitter feed from "For you" to "Following" for logged-in users. By default, Twitter's "For you" feed shows tweets and activity from accounts that Twitter's algorithm thinks are relevant to you, regardless of whether you follow those accounts. This can be frustrating for users who prefer to see tweets only from accounts they follow. TwitterFollowingDefault solves this problem by changing the default feed to "Following," which shows tweets only from accounts you follow.
